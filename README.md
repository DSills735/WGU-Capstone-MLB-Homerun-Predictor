# WGU-Capstone-MLB-Homerun-Predictor

Logistic and Linear Regression ML Algorithms used with a dataset from all batted balls in the 2024 MLB season. This was my capstone project for my BS in CS at WGU. This uses launch angle, exit velocity and pitch speed, and compares it against all batted balls in 2024. This attempts to predict if the outcome is a homerun, and how far the ball would fly. Based on tests, this was 66% accurate with predicitons, and on average within 15 feet of the actual carry distance.
